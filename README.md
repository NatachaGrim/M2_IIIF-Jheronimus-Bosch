# About this IIIF project

Assessment instructions:

> The goal is to a play a little role playing game: pretend that you are an employee of a cultural heritage institution, a university, or a research lab that has to valorize a given set of images. You are sent by your employers to follow this IIIF Training Tutorial, and then you will report back to your colleagues on what IIIF can bring to your collection.

Assuming I am part of an institution promoting Jheronimus Bosch's works, here is my fictitious proposal:

_As our aim is to promote Jheronimus Bosch’s triptychs by creating a digital library, I suggest we use the standards provided by IIIF. This will guarantee an online access to high-quality images, capable of transcribing in high definition all the details which typify Bosch’s paintings. Although my preliminary work will be brief, we will be able to fill in a wealth of metadata and extensively annotate each panel in order to display a consistent exegesis of Bosch’s work. I shall work on three triptychs, more precisely on both open and closed versions, for a total of six images:_
- _[The Haywain Triptych](images/haywain/full/full/0/default.jpg) ;_
- _[The Haywain Triptych](images/haywain_shuttered/full/full/0/default.jpg) (closed) ;_
- _[The Garden of Earthly Delights](images/the_garden_of_earthly_delights/full/full/0/default.jpg) ;_
- _[The Garden of Earthly Delights](images/the_garden_of_earthly_delights_shuttered/full/full/0/default.jpg) (closed) ;_
- _[The Last Judgment](images/the_last_judgement/full/full/0/default.jpg) ;_
- _[The Last Judgment](images/the_last_judgement_shuttered/full/full/0/default.jpg) (closed)._

Due to unresolved technical problems, only three of the six images could be annotated:
- [The Haywain Triptych](images/haywain/full/full/0/default.jpg) ;
- [The Haywain Triptych](images/haywain_shuttered/full/full/0/default.jpg) (closed) ;
- [The Garden of Earthly Delights](images/the_garden_of_earthly_delights_shuttered/full/full/0/default.jpg).
